# Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer but poorly translated (working title)
This is a poor translation of [Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_Happy_Home_Designer) for the [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console). As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considered.

# Some questions, and some answers

### What the hell is this
Basically the same idea as [acnl-translated](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated), just for Happy Home Designer.

### Where's the warning?
Same warning as [acnl-translated](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated), just for Happy Home Designer. I also cannot be bothered to copy the warning over.

### So, how much have you done?
I've made an icon. Impressive?

### Should I be seeing this?
You should.

# Documentation
Simular to this mod's [New Leaf counterpart](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated), I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. As of right now, that documentation does not exist. It will be available [here.](https://github.com/vilijur/achhd-translated/wiki)

# Credits
Nothing to credit right now...

# That's all
Have a nice day! **:>**
