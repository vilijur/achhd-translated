# Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer but poorly translated (working title)
This is a (Work in progress) poor translation of [Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_Happy_Home_Designer) for the [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console). As of now, it's planned to just replace the text, however changing the graphics may be considered.

# **Notice**
Currently, progress on this mod has been suspended until further notice. This also applies to [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated) and [Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival](https://github.com/vilijur/acaf-translated) (Amiibo Festival has no progress anyways)


# Some questions, and some answers

### What the hell is this
Basically the same idea as [acnl-translated](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated), just for Happy Home Designer.

### Where's the warning?
It's the same warning as [acnl-translated](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated#warning), just for Happy Home Designer. I also cannot be bothered to copy the warning over.

### So, how much have you done?
Done work on the UI, will finish soon. By soon i mean never lololololololololololol

### Should I be seeing this?
You should.

# Documentation
Simular to this mod's [New Leaf counterpart](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated), I do plan to document the prosess so that others can do not just text hacks, but also ROM hacks for Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer. As of right now, that documentation does not exist. It will be available [here.](https://github.com/vilijur/achhd-translated/wiki)

# Credits
wooo credits
ok here we go
everything - vilijur
that's it

# One more thing...
I'm also working on other poor translations (in my own time) with [Animal Crossing: New Leaf](https://github.com/vilijur/acnl-translated) and [Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival](https://github.com/vilijur/acaf-translated). You can click on the hyperlinks to be taken to their respective repo, assuming it exists and is not private.

oh and btw the animal crossing series is called `Expensive Transition` now. This game will be called `Expensive Transition: Happy Creators at Home` when it's in a better state then a small amount of the game's text has been changed, or when I can be bothered. Whichever comes first.

# That's all
Have a nice day! **:>**
